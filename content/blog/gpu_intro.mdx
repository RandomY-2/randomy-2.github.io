## Why Learn GPU Architecture?

Modern applications—from graphics rendering and video processing to machine learning and scientific
simulation—rely heavily on GPUs. Unlike CPUs, which are optimized for latency-sensitive, sequential
tasks, GPUs are engineered for **throughput** and **massive parallelism**.

## Architectural Divergence Between CPU and GPU

<div align="center">
![Figure 1: CPU vs. GPU](/figures/cpu-vs-gpu.png)
</div>

The above diagram provides an abstract visualization of the architectural distinctions between CPUs
and GPUs. It represents the relative transistor allocation for different functional components using
colored regions. In this schematic, green indicates computational units, gold denotes instruction
control and scheduling logic, purple corresponds to L1 cache, blue represents higher-level caches
(e.g., L2 or L3), and orange signifies DRAM (in reality size should be much larger relatively).

The relative area of each block reflects the design emphasis of each architecture:

- CPUs allocate more transistors
to **control logic and large caches** and is good for multitasking and fast **serial processing**

- GPUs prioritize **computational throughput** by dedicating more area to arithmetic units.

In simple words from a [Cornell Workshop](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/gpu-architecture/gpu-characteristics/design):

>1. CPUs can handle more complex workflows compared to GPUs.
>2. CPUs don't have as many arithmetic logic units or floating point units as GPUs
(the small green boxes above, roughly speaking), but the ALUs and FPUs in a CPU core are individually more capable.
>3. CPUs have more cache memory than GPUs.

## Compute Units: Large-and-Smart vs. Small-and-Many

A key distinction lies in the nature and number of compute units (or **cores**). CPUs typically have a
small number of complex, high-performance cores capable of executing out-of-order instructions,
speculative branches, and sophisticated prediction mechanisms. These features allow CPUs to minimize
latency for single-threaded workloads and to dynamically optimize control flow during execution.

In contrast, GPUs consist of hundreds or even thousands of simpler cores that operate under the **Single
Instruction, Multiple Threads (SIMT)** paradigm. These cores are not designed to handle complex control
logic or branch prediction. Instead, they excel at performing simple, arithmetic-heavy operations—such
as fused multiply-add (FMA)—across large volumes of data.

Although SIMT is conceptually related to SIMD, it introduces a crucial relaxation: thread-level predication.
In SIMD, all data lanes execute the same instruction unconditionally, which limits expressiveness in
control flow. SIMT, by contrast, allows threads within a **warp** (typically 32 threads) to diverge and
execute different paths conditionally, using **per-thread masking**. For example, in a warp encountering
an `if-else` branch, threads for which the condition evaluates to `true` will be active during the execution
of the `if` block, while the others are deactivated. Afterward, the inactive threads are reactivated for
the `else` block, and the roles reverse.

<div align="center">

</div>

It is worth emphasizing that although we speak of "cores" in both CPU and GPU contexts, they are not equivalent
in capability or granularity. A single GPU core—a **CUDA core**--is more accurately
comparable to a single vector lane within the vector processing unit of a CPU. CUDA cores operate in groups,
such as of 32, executing the same instruction simultaneously on different data elements. This SIMD-style execution
is central to GPU performance. While CPUs also support SIMD via vector units, these typically operate on much
smaller widths (e.g., 128-bit or 256-bit registers processing 4, 8, or 16 elements). Consequently, GPU cores are
optimized for bulk throughput over large data arrays, whereas CPU vector units provide modest parallelism tightly
coupled with control-rich logic. The following are more terms explained from the Cornell Workshop.

## Memory Hierarchy: Cache-Coherent vs. Software-Managed

<div align="center">
![Figure 2: GPU Memory Architecture](/figures/gpu-memory-archi.png)
</div>

Memory subsystems further illustrate the architectural divergence between CPUs and GPUs.
CPU memory hierarchies are built around deep, hardware-managed cache systems—including L1,
L2, and a shared L3 cache—which aim to minimize DRAM latency while remaining fully transparent
to the programmer. These caches are coherent and dynamically updated by hardware, allowing CPUs
to support workloads with complex branching, irregular data access, and pointer-heavy memory
patterns efficiently.

GPU memory hierarchies, in contrast, are more explicitly tiered and programmer-visible. At the top
sits **global memory**—typically implemented as high-bandwidth GDDR or HBM—which provides substantial
throughput but incurs relatively high access latency. Each **Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)** includes
a **shared memory** segment, a low-latency, explicitly managed scratchpad that facilitates intra-block
communication and data reuse. Specialized memory types, such as **constant** and **texture memory**,
offer additional access optimizations for read-only and spatially-local workloads.

GPUs do have cache structures (e.g., L1 per SM and a unified L2 cache shared across SMs), but these are
generally shallower and less sophisticated than their CPU counterparts. Each CPU core includes dedicated
L1 and L2 caches and a partitioned share of a larger L3 cache, yielding significantly more total cache
space per core than is available on a typical GPU.

## CUDA Programming Model

The CUDA programming model exposes the GPU’s parallel execution capabilities to the developer.
A CUDA program consists of **host code** (CPU) and **device code** (GPU). The host initiates
GPU work by launching **kernel functions**—device routines marked `__global__`. Conceptually,
a kernel is written as if it will execute on a **single thread**; at launch, the runtime instantiates
that same function across a user-specified grid of threads (often thousands or millions). Thus,
one source-level kernel maps to many concurrent thread instances, each operating on different data.

An example CUDA and host code are as follows:

<div align="center">
![Figure 4: CUDA Code](/figures/cuda-code-example.png)
</div>

The drawback of heterogeneous CPU–GPU computing is the **communication overhead across the host–device boundary**.
Even with high-bandwidth interconnects (e.g., NVLink), the latency and bandwidth of CPU–GPU transfers and kernel
launch latencies are orders of magnitude worse than on-chip memory accesses.

### Hierarchical Parallelism

CUDA expresses parallel work in a three-level hierarchy, closely mirroring the underlying hardware:

1. **Thread**
   The smallest execution context. Each thread owns its own program counter, predicate registers,
    and a slice of the SM’s large register file.  A thread can access *registers* (fast, private),
	*local memory* (off-chip spill space), *shared memory* (if declared `__shared__`), and *global memory* (per grid).

2. **Thread Block**
   A cooperative group of threads that execute concurrently on a single Streaming Multiprocessor.
   Threads in the same block can synchronize with the barrier primitive `__syncthreads()` and exchange data
   through low-latency *shared memory*.  Modern GPUs allow up to 1024 resident threads per block; several
   blocks may occupy the same SM simultaneously if resources remain.

3. **Grid**
   The collection of all blocks launched by a single kernel invocation.  Blocks in a grid are independent:
   they share global memory but have no implicit ordering or direct synchronization mechanism.  Global coordination
   therefore requires either multiple kernel launches or newer features such as *Cooperative Groups*.


<div align="center">
![Figure 3: Thread Block Grid](/figures/thread-block-grid.png)
</div>

A block is mapped to execute on a single SM and is the scope for fast barrier sync
(`__syncthreads()`) and programmer-managed **shared memory**. Multiple blocks can co-reside
on one SM, subject to resource limits (registers, shared memory, warp slots).

Warps (32 threads on NVIDIA, 64 on many AMD GPUs) are the entities actually issued by the
SM’s schedulers. All threads in a warp execute the same decoded instruction each cycle,
with per-thread predication masking off inactive lanes during divergent branches. Warp–shuffle intrinsics
enable lane-to-lane data exchange without using shared memory.

Each thread owns its own program counter and register slice, but at the hardware level it is one lane
within a warp. The compiler determines how many registers on each SM is allocated to each thread; excess
demand spills to device memory (“local” memory), which is slower though often cached.

GPUs are throughput-oriented. When a warp stalls on a long-latency operation (e.g., a global memory load),
the SM continues by executing another ready warp—**Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP)**. Compilers
and hardware also exploit **Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)** within a warp’s instruction stream (issuing
independent arithmetic ops while others wait).

How many blocks (and thus warps) can be active on an SM—often termed **occupancy**—is bounded by three primary factors:

1. **Threads per block** (block size, up to 1,024 on most NVIDIA GPUs).
2. **Registers per thread**, multiplied by threads per block, must fit in the SM’s register file.
3. **Shared memory per block**, which is carved out of the SM’s on-chip scratchpad.

Large blocks with heavy register or shared-memory footprints can throttle concurrency to one or two blocks per SM; smaller
or lighter-weight blocks allow the scheduler to resident more blocks and thus more warps.

## Optimizations for GPU Programming

This section outlines some optimization techniques for GPU programming, as described in
[this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3570638), into four themes:

1. **Memory Access** – Because memory latency are often much slower than computation latency,
	optimizing data movement is important.

2. **Irregularity** – Mapping irregular algorithms onto the highly regular GPU.

3. **Balancing** – Ensuring the hardware stays busy and no resource becomes the bottleneck.

4. **Host Interaction** – Overlapping PCIe/NVLink transfers with kernels, batching launches, keeping data resident
	on device, and coordinating multi-kernel pipelines.

### Memory Access

Optimizing for memory access is an important theme in GPU programming because GPUs are computationally very strong due
to the high degree of parallelism whereas memory access is typically much slower than computation.

#### On-Chip Optimizations

On-chip resources—registers, shared memory, warp-wide intrinsics, and the small L1/L2 caches—are the first line of defense
against the high latency of off-chip DRAM. Effective kernels aggressively exploit these structures to maximize data reuse,
 reduce traffic to global memory, and avoid serialization hazards.

**Use Specialized On-Chip Memories.**
GPUs expose several dedicated, fast paths besides generic caches. **Constant memory** provides broadcast-friendly, read-only
storage: when all threads in a warp read the same location, the access collapses to a single memory transaction.
**Texture memory** is a read-only, hardware-cached space with a dedicated cache tuned for 2D spatial locality. It provides
built-in filtering and address-mode handling (e.g., clamp/repeat) and is frequently leveraged in GPGPU kernels to speed
irregular or strided accesses and lightweight format conversions.
**Shared memory** is a software-managed memory allocated per thread block and physically resident in the SM. It enables
low-latency sharing of data between threads in the same thread block, but demands careful layout to prevent
bank conflicts. Padding, index remapping, or data reordering are common tactics to ensure threads in a warp hit
different banks.

**Exploit Warp-Level Primitives.** Since Kepler-generation GPUs, NVIDIA has exposed warp-level intrinsics that enable
intra-warp communication without shared memory or block-wide barriers. **Warp-vote** operations
evaluate predicates at warp-level and broadcast result to all threads in the warp, while
**warp-shuffle** operations share data intra-warp without going through shared
memory. These instructions cut latency and shared-memory pressure and
are routinely used to implement warp-scope reductions, scans, compaction, and small-tile transpositions.

**Exploit Warp-Level Primitives.**
Since Kepler-era GPUs, **warp-vote** and **warp-shuffle** instructions allow threads in a warp to reach consensus
without explicitly synchronizing at block scope. These intrinsics cut latency and
pressure on shared memory, and are particularly effective for collectives like reductions, scans, ballot-based compaction,
or small-tile transpositions.

**Register Blocking (Temporal Blocking).**
Registers are the fastest storage available and are private to each thread. Keeping temporally reused scalars in registers
eliminates repeated loads from shared or global memory. This is especially useful in stencil codes and accumulation-heavy
kernels. Because registers cannot be indexed dynamically, compilers or templates often unroll loops and scalarize arrays
to keep values in registers.

**Reduce Register Usage**
Excessive register use throttles occupancy and may trigger **spilling** to off-chip “local” memory. Techniques include:
minimizing temporary variables, packing small types, recomputing cheap expressions instead of storing them, moving rarely
reused data to shared memory, or explicitly capping registers per thread (with care). Loop unrolling can both help (fewer
induction variables) and hurt (more live values); measure and tune.

**Recompute When Cheaper Than Reload.**
On modern GPUs, flops are abundant and memory is scarce. Recomputing values—especially simple arithmetic or address
calculations—can be faster than fetching them from memory. Combined with kernel fusion, recomputation avoids writing
intermediates to global memory and subsequent reloading, reducing synchronization and bandwidth costs.

#### Off-Chip Optimizations

**Coalesced Access.** Global-memory bandwidth is maximized when the 32 threads of a warp access contiguous, properly
aligned addresses so the hardware can serve them with a few wide transactions instead of many narrow ones. Achieving
coalescing may require reorganizing data (e.g., struct-of-arrays, transpositions, padding), remapping threads to data,
tiling through shared memory (load coalesced, then access arbitrarily), or even adopting alternative parallelization
strategies and index schemes (e.g., space-filling curves). For highly irregular workloads (sparse matrices, graphs),
custom data formats and caching strategies are often necessary to approximate coalesced behavior.

**Spatial Blocking (Loop Tiling).** Partition computations and data into tiles that fit on-chip, processing one tile at
a time. Spatial blocking increases locality in L1/L2 caches, texture caches, registers, and shared memory, and can also
reduce warp divergence. Tile dimensions can be auto-tuned and need not match thread-block dimensions, enabling flexible
work-per-thread choices.

**Kernel Fusion.** Merging kernels that consume/produce the same data avoids intermediate global-memory writes/reads,
reduces kernel-launch overhead, and can improve cache reuse. The trade-off is higher register and shared-memory usage
in the fused kernel, which can depress occupancy. Balance fusion benefits against resource pressure.

**Software Prefetching.** Although GPUs hide latency using warp switching, explicit prefetching (often double-buffered)
in application code can pipeline memory and computation within a kernel iteration. Prefetch the next tile’s data into
registers/shared memory  while computing on the current tile to smooth stalls. Warp specialization—dedicating a warp to
prefetch—can also be effective.

**Data Compression.** Compressing inputs on the host and transferring compressed representations can cut PCIe/NVLink
traffic and device memory footprint; decompression on the GPU trades a few ALU cycles for bandwidth savings. Sparse formats
are classic examples, but compression helps in other domains as well.

**Precompute.** Shift work upstream by computing reusable values on the host (or once on the device) and storing them
for later reuse. This saves runtime arithmetic at the cost of extra memory traffic and storage, making it the conceptual
opposite of recomputation. Use it when memory pressure is manageable and the saved computation is significant.

### Irregularity

GPU is a highly regular architecture, but many  algorithms feature irregular control flow, uneven memory access patterns,
or input‑dependent work distribution. Performance hinges on reshaping such workloads to match the GPU’s SIMT execution
model while minimizing divergence and imbalance.

**Loop Unrolling.**  Unrolling replicates the body of a loop multiple times—manually or via compiler directives—to cut
branch and address‑calculation overhead, expose more independent instructions for ILP, and unlock further optimizations
such as keeping temporaries in registers.  Excessive unrolling, however, inflates register pressure and can reduce occupancy;
the unroll factor must be tuned per kernel and architecture.

**Reduce Branch Divergence.**  When threads in a warp take different branch paths, execution serializes and inactive lanes
idle.  Remedies include refactoring branches into predicated arithmetic, flattening conditional logic, using lookup tables,
or rearranging data and thread mappings so that adjacent threads follow the same path.  In some cases, accepting limited
redundant computation is faster than divergent branching.

**Sparse Data Formats.**  For sparse linear algebra or graph processing, the memory format dictates SIMD
efficiency.  GPU‑oriented formats—such as ELL/ELLR, SELL‑C‑σ, or hybrid combinations (e.g., HYB)—pad or reorder non‑zeros
to equalize work per row and enable coalesced loads.  Dynamic or compressed formats further trade computation for bandwidth
when the sparsity pattern changes at runtime.

**Kernel Fission.**  Splitting a monolithic, irregular kernel into multiple simpler kernels can tighten resource usage,
reduce divergence, and improve auto‑tuner search space.  Each fissioned kernel focuses on a more regular sub‑task, at the
expense of extra launches and global synchronizations—trade‑offs that must be weighed against resource savings.

**Avoid Redundant Work.**  This optimization consists
of avoiding to perform work that is considered redundant. Its implementation is usually algorithm-specific and it is the
opposite of recomputing values

### Balancing
Although GPUs are relatively simple architectures, many architectural details are highly interconnected and require careful
balancing to achieve performance.

#### Instruction‑Stream Balancing

**Vectorization.** Load and operate on `int4`, `float4`, or `double2` vectors so each instruction touches multiple data
elements. This reduces branch and pointer arithmetic overhead, improves coalesced memory access, and can align transfers
to 16‑ or 32‑byte boundaries. Padding or data‑layout changes may be required to maintain alignment.

**Fast Math Functions.** CUDA’s `-use_fast_math` flag and intrinsics such as `__expf`, `__sinf`, or SFU‑backed `__fdividef`
deliver lower‑precision but significantly faster results. On Ampere+ devices, tensor cores accelerate half‑, TF32‑, and
bfloat16‑precision matrix–tensor products, accessible through WMMA or library calls, shifting the bottleneck from math
to memory.

**Warp‑Centric Programming.** Organize work so a warp (rather than a thread) is the fundamental scheduling unit. Warps can
cooperatively load tiles into shared memory, perform collective reductions via `__shfl_sync`, or specialize into
producer/consumer roles. This reduces block‑level barriers and exploits warp‑wide broadcast latency of 1–2 cycles.

#### Parallelism‑Balancing

**Vary Work per Thread.** Assign multiple iterations or data tiles to each thread (thread/warp coarsening). This boosts
register‑level reuse and amortizes index calculations, but raises register and shared‑memory pressure.

**Resize Thread Blocks.** Choosing 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1 024 threads per block affects occupancy, barrier efficiency,
and shared‑memory allocation granularity. Larger blocks expose more on‑chip parallelism but may limit concurrent blocks
per SM; smaller blocks ease register pressure and allow finer‑grain scheduling.

**Auto‑Tuning.** Frameworks such as Kernel Tuner, CLTune, and OpenTuner explore multidimensional spaces—block size, tile
shape, unroll factor, memory layout—using search heuristics or ML models. Auto‑tuning yields device‑ and input‑specific
configurations, improving both raw throughput and performance portability.

**Load Balancing.** Irregular workloads (graphs, sparse matrices) suffer when some warps idle. Solutions include work‑lists
with task stealing, CSR/ELL hybrid formats, frontier compaction, and persistent threads that dynamically fetch new work.
At the multi‑device level, static or adaptive CPU/GPU partitions balance heterogeneous resources.

#### Synchronization‑Balancing

**Reduce Synchronization.** Eliminate unnecessary barriers by fusing stages, privatizing intermediate data, or
double‑buffering tiles so computations proceed while data is loaded. When unavoidable, keep enough independent warps
resident to cover barrier latency.

**Reduce Atomics.** Atomic operations allow programmers to perform parallel memory updates without conflicts, but atomics
introduce synchronization overhead. Aggregate updates in shared memory, perform warp‑level reductions (`__shfl_xor_sync`),
or restructure data to minimize contended locations. In some algorithms, approximate or relaxed‑consistency methods can
replace exact atomics without affecting end results.

**Inter‑Block Synchronization.** CUDA ≥ 9 provides `cooperative_groups::grid_group` and `grid.sync()` for whole‑grid
barriers on Pascal‑class GPUs and newer, avoiding costly kernel relaunches. Pre‑Pascal devices can emulate barriers with
lock‑free or atomic‑based algorithms that poll global flags and spin only within a few hundred cycles.

### Host Interaction

Efficient host–device coordination is critical to end‑to‑end performance once kernels are tuned.  Optimizations fall into
two groups: minimizing the cost of communication over PCIe/NVLink and judiciously partitioning computation between
CPU and GPU.

#### Host Communication

**Eliminate Transfers.** Execute entire pipelines on the GPU or keep persistent data resident across multiple kernels,
avoiding PCIe/NVLink traffic altogether.

**Compression.** Compress payloads on the CPU, transfer the smaller representation, and decompress on‑device—a net win when
bandwidth, not compute, is the bottleneck.

**Pinned & Mapped Memory.** Allocate page‑locked buffers (`cudaHostAlloc` or `cudaMallocHost`) to enable direct DMA and
higher transfer throughput; map them into the GPU address space (`cudaHostGetDevicePointer`) when zero‑copy access is profitable.

**Overlap Communication and Computation.** Use CUDA streams (or OpenCL command queues) to pipeline asynchronous
`cudaMemcpyAsync` calls with kernel launches.  Double‑ or triple‑buffering hides latency by ensuring one buffer is in transit
while another is being processed.

**Dynamic Parallelism & Unified Memory.** Move control loops on‑device by allowing kernels to launch child kernels, or employ
unified memory to present a single address space; both approaches reduce round‑trip latency for fine‑grained tasks.

#### CPU/GPU Computation

**Task Decomposition.** Partition the application into coarse tasks that run independently on CPU and GPU, communicating only
at well‑defined boundaries; this is effective for heterogeneous workloads such as vision pipelines or irregular graph analytics.

**Static vs. Dynamic Load Balancing.** Static schemes assign a fixed work fraction (e.g., 70 % GPU, 30 % CPU) based on
profiling, while dynamic schemes monitor progress and migrate work adaptively using shared work queues or runtime schedulers.

**Data‑Transfer‑Aware Scheduling.** When tasks have dependencies, schedule them to minimize the number and size of host–device
transfers, possibly batching multiple small tasks into a single transfer window.

**Overlap and Pipeline.** For producer–consumer workflows, run CPU pre‑processing, GPU compute, and CPU post‑processing as
concurrent pipeline stages, each operating on different data batches buffered in pinned memory.
